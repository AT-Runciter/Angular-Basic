# Angular-Basic

Hi! This repository contains my experiments with Angular.
These tasks go from the simplest to the most complex - from the first steps to creating components to experimenting with a login page.

What's going on here: my first attempts. The assignments were as follows:
1. Delete the markup in the app.component.html file and create a paragraph with any content. Add a first-level heading with any text in the index.html file.
2. Enter a command or edit the packege.json file in the project, its start field, so that the project opens automatically in the browser after it starts.
3. Create several components through the angular cli by naming them: header, content, footer. Give three components the markup you want and display these components on the visual part of the application page.
4. Write down the general styles that will be set for all components and the styles that will be set for html elements only for a specific component.

What has been done: a project with simple routing has been created, with three routes. The assignments were as follows:
1. Add an image tag and pass the local or absolute path to the image using data binding.
2. Create a slider without animation. Place an image and two buttons "Back" and "Forward" below it. In the component, create an array with paths (relative or absolute) to different images. Change the path to the image by substituting the values of the array when you press the keys.
3. Implement the ability to switch slides using the keyboard.
